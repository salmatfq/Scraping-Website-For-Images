# Scraping-Website-For-Images

As part of a project I am working on, I need to build my own dataset of images of certain types of buildings. 
This is an example of what I used to scrape some images from the real estate website Zillow.
The code can be further tweaked and tailored to scrape other data from Zillow and/or from a different website.
